### API og Data-scraping

Should we assume, that all vendors want to sign up?

What if for example there are 100 bettings vendors, but only 6 sign up. Can we still claim we show the "best odds", as they might be found in the other 94 vendors.

If we do data-scraping, it would be hard to actually place bets on the respective sites, without proper confirmations etc.

To avoid complications of legal situations and latency we go with api and assume most vendors provide an api we can use.

### MitID integration

As we are doing betting, we need a license from "Spillemyndighederne", and follow their related laws.
That includes MitID integration, for logging in, and also for getting payments out.
Should we spent a lot of time and illustrations showing this, or is it simply "given" by the case, and illustration is not really necessary.

### Placing multiple bets where one fails

The betting sites allowing for multiple bets can reject the package of bets if one of them fails. Our system will not be able to handle this.

### Statistics?

A possibility to view betting statistics.
