### Should we be a broker, or only an aggregator

If we are an aggregator showing the "best odds", it would be tough for us to take a margin, as that margin would possibly reduce the odds such that it isn't no longer the best odds, only due to our cut.

Alternatively, we could do something like a subscriber model for our product. But i suspect that people would quickly calculate that as a percentage cut of their bettings aswell, and therefore again reduce the chance that the customer would percieve it as the best odds available

Therefore, we think it would be easier to take a cut, on a service usually not available on other sides, which is acting as a stock broker just for betting.
Meaning that people themselves would be able to open a position on som bet, and therefore act as the vendor themselves, for other people to buy their odds. This would cost a fee, quite similar to the ordinary fees one pays on the stock market.

### Increase in new customers, or does it eat from the existing customer base.

So imagine one of the biggest podcasts our there from Conan O' Brian, who is mainly on Spotify with audio only.
They are now experimenting with putting episodes on youtube with video as well.
But they are afraid that it won't give more customers, instead people will migrate from spotify to youtube.

This is a concern for the betting vendors as well, where there are mainly two scenarios:

- Best case: Some customer who only uses X, instead now uses our platform and therefore indirectly ends up using A, B, C, D.... who never had a chance before to be used by this customer. They all see an increase, because this customer who now have more options and advantages starts betting 250 % more. So even though site X will see a decrease from this customer, there might be other customers who only uses A, that will now also start using X.
- Worst case: Some customer who only bets 50 kr. each month on X, will now still only place 50 kr each month, but now on A, B, X. Thus no additional revenue would be added to the pot.

### Only sport??

Most of these sites also have:

- Bingo
- Casino & Live casino
- Poker & other card games
- Raffles
- eSport (One might claim they are the same)
- Quizzes and giveaways

While these might make sense in our business scope, it will be too much for this 1 year project, therefore we only focus on sport - not because it is the best choice, but it is feasible within our scope of this course.

### Offers

Is it feasible for our site to have offers, such as a welcome bonus.
This might be rough, because that would give the customers multiple stacked welcome bonusses, one from our site, aswell as one from the site they are placing the bet on.

### Keep track of best users

Allow people to see the most successful users so they can follow their bets.

### Show bet limitations

The UI must show the limitations of bets. "This bet gives 2:9 but max bet amount is 75kr."

### Legal concerns

There must be advertised "Rofus" and "Stop Spillet". Furthermore, there must be a timer that makes the user aware of their time spent betting.

### Casino income

So ALL of the betting sites we checked with danish license (42), all used their own external casino vendors, such as pragmatic.com As such, we can easily an efficinetly have a casino tab aswell, playing external vendors. There is no "down-payment", as we act merely as affiliate, and get a provision from the vendors. This might be of conflict for our own betting site key partners, as if they start using our site, the income generated on slotmachines, will be reduced from our partners, as we eventually eat their customers. Alternatively is we don't provide casino (slots, live roulette etc.), as to please our key partners.

### Sepparate saldo and bonus

Bonus money staying in the betting site acts differently than cash that can be withdrawn directly etc. The site must display how much is bonus and how much is not.

### Forum?

Having a forum on the site will act as marketing when users encourage each other to place bets.

### Streaming?

We could use streaming through for example bet365 so users who want to watch matches live won't be scared away.

### BetBÃ¸rs is apparently already a thing

Our community bets exist on BetFair.

### International?

Could this be expanded to be used outside of Denmark?

### 2 customer profiles

Betters.
Bookmakers. New bookmakers can use our service to announce themselves and gain users.

### EU wallet

In a reality where EU wallet has been integrated it would make our system more efficient for handling money on the different platforms.

Alternatively we can pay up front using money they have on our site until they confirm using MitID.
If they cancel we cancel.

### Where is the money

Having them place money on our site makes it easier for the user to just put 200 and then bet where ever instead of having to place 200 on multiple site. The down side is that we now need to handle security and all the behind the scenes transactions.

### Are we a bookmaker?
